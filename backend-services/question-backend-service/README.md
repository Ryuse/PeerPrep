# PeerPrep - Question Backend Service

TypeScript service that:

- Provides Create Operations for adding questions from the LeetCode Service or other services
- Provides CRUD operations for questions for Admin users.
- Get the categories and corresponding difficulties with questions
- Get a random question based on a set of categories and difficulties.

## Tech

- TypeScript (ESM), Node.js
- Bottleneck (rate limiting)
- Fastify, @fastify/cors
- MongoDB (Atlas)

## Running Question Service

**Before running** check for the following requirements:

- MongoDB Atlas
- Docker

1. Open Command Line/Terminal and navigate into the `question-backend-service` directory.

2. Run the command: `npm install`. This will install all the necessary dependencies.

3. Clone `.env.example` and rename it as `.env`.

4. Replace `<db_password>` in the `MONGODB_URI` and `ADMIN_TOKEN` variable with your MongoDB Atlas account password.

5. Run the command `npm run dev` to start the Question Service.

6. Using applications like Postman, you can interact with the Question Service on port 5275.

## Running with Docker

1. Follow steps 1 to 4 from [Running Question Service](#running-question-service).

2. Run `docker compose up --build`.

3. Using applications like Postman, you can interact with the Question Service on port 5275.
