# CS3219 Project (PeerPrep) - AY2526S1

PeerPrep is a technical interview preparation platform designed to help students and professionals practice coding interviews together in a real-time collaborative environment.
The platform leverages a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.

Users can find peers to practice with, match based on topic preferences, and collaborate on coding problems in real-time.

Use PeerPrep [here](https://d1h013fkmpx3nu.cloudfront.net).

## Running the PeerPrep application with Docker

**Before running** check for the following requirements:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) (for pulling required base images)

> **Note:** Make sure Docker Engine is running before executing any commands.

---

### Environment Configuration

Each **frontend** and **backend** service in PeerPrep requires its own `.env` file for configuration.

You can find sample environment files (`.env.example`) in each corresponding directory.  
Copy each one to a `.env` file and fill in the required values according to your local setup.

#### Frontend Services

Create `.env` files for the following:

```
./ui-shell
./ui-services/collab-ui-service
./ui-services/history-ui-service
./ui-services/matching-ui-service
./ui-services/question-ui-service
./ui-services/user-ui-service
```

#### Backend Services

Create `.env` files for the following:

```
./backend-services/chatting-backend-service
./backend-services/collab-backend-service
./backend-services/history-backend-service
./backend-services/leetcode-backend-service
./backend-services/matching-backend-service
./backend-services/question-backend-service
./backend-services/user-backend-service
```

## Each `.env.example` contains all required keys for that service.

### Running the Application

Once all `.env` files are set up:

1. Navigate to the **root directory** of the project.
2. Run the following command to build and start all containers:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

This will:

- Build all backend and frontend service containers.
- Start the complete PeerPrep system locally.
- Expose the services as defined in the `docker-compose.yml`.

> The first build may take several minutes as dependencies are downloaded and containers are built.

---

### Verifying Deployment

Once all containers are up and running, you can:

- Access the **UI Shell** (main app) via [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
- Check logs for any service with:

  ```bash
  docker compose logs -f <service-name>
  ```

- Verify connectivity between services using the Docker Dashboard or:

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
